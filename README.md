## 👩‍🏫 About Me
I am a dedicated and passionate researcher specializing in **neurotechnology**, **machine learning**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **neuroimaging**. Currently pursuing a PhD in **Computational Neuroscience** at **UC San Diego**, I focus on developing digital biomarkers for cognitive decline through technologies like **virtual reality**, **eye-tracking**, and **speech analysis**.

## 🔬 Research Focus
- 🧠 **Cognitive Decline and Biomarkers**: Leveraging **VR**, **eye-tracking**, and **speech analysis** for early detection of cognitive impairment.
- 🖥️ **Machine Learning in Neuroscience**: Developing predictive models for perioperative neurocognitive disorders using **fMRI**, **EEG**, and clinical data.
- 🗣️ **Natural Language Processing**: Using advanced NLP techniques and models (e.g., BERT) to analyze linguistic patterns in Alzheimer's patients.

## 🔑 Key Projects
1. **Virtual Reality Cognitive Training** 🕶️  
   Developed VR-based cognitive tasks to assess memory and spatial learning in adults, using **C#** and **Unity3D**. Integrated **eye-tracking** and **pupillometry** data via **SRanipal SDK** and **OpenXR** for real-time cognitive performance analysis.

2. **Speech Analysis and NLP for Alzheimer’s Research** 🧠🗣️  
   Created pipelines using **spaCy**, **NLTK**, and **BERT** to analyze speech features such as lexical complexity and emotional fluency in Alzheimer's patients.

3. **Machine Learning for Predictive Modeling** 🤖  
   Led development of machine learning models to predict perioperative neurocognitive disorders, integrating **fMRI**, **EEG**, and clinical data using **TensorFlow**, **Scikit-learn**, and **MNE-Python**.

## 💡 Technical Skills
- **Languages**: Python 🐍, C# 🖥️, C++ 💻, Java ☕, Matlab 📊
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: TensorFlow 🔥, PyTorch 🧠, scikit-learn, OpenCV 🖼️, Unity 🎮
- **Tools**: Git 🛠️, Docker 🐳, AWS ☁️, Next.js, OpenXR
- **Specialized Software**: MNE-Python, SRanipal SDK, EEG/fMRI data analysis tools
